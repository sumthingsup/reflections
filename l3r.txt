When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When collaborating with other people or doing the project on multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There may be changes that are not yet up to production level.
