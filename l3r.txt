When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When collaborating with other people or doing the project on multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There may be changes that are not yet up to production level.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are a feature of Github which is basically a clone on their machines. Clones are copies of repositories which can be from any location aside from Github to Github. Branches are a set of commits that may or may not have changes. These are useful for testing changes and for pushing versions of a repository that you do not want publicized.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Whenever the local and remote repositories are out of sync, a pull or a fetch will update the last known state of the remote instead of the master, which keeps intact the local master while allowing for conflict resolution with the remote changes.
